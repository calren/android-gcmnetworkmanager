# GcmNetworkManager Quickstart

## Introduction

GcmNetworkManager can be used to reliably schedule network operations in your application based
on time, charging status, connectivity, and other variables.  GcmNetworkManager is similar to the
Android [JobScheduler](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler.html)
API which is available on all Android devices running Lollipop or higher, however GcmNetworkManager
is available on any device running Google Play Services.
